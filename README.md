## 🚧 This vault was abandoned! 🚧

Hi, this mini-game was created in Ruby as part of my test case for choosing the best library to develop my dream game. It was originally intended to be a large open-source project where everyone could contribute, but later, I stepped away from game development for a while. Now, I’m busy with other projects, but you can follow the latest updates here - 👉 ...

Feel free to modify and use this project however you like!

## Get started

```bash
# ruby 3.3.2
bundle install
ruby main.rb 
```
